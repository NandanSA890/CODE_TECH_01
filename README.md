Project:Simple Calculator

A simple calculator program in Python aims to perform basic arithmetic operations. Below are the key objectives for such a program:
 1. Perform Basic Arithmetic Operations
   - Addition: Add two or more numbers.
   - Subtraction: Subtract one number from another.
   - Multiplication: Multiply two or more numbers.
   - Division: Divide one number by another (with error handling for division by zero).
   
 2. User Input Handling
   - Take inputs from the user for numbers and the operation they wish to perform.
   - Ensure proper input validation, such as checking for non-numeric inputs and handling incorrect or invalid operations.
   
3. Output Results
   - Display the result of the chosen operation to the user.
   
4. Error Handling
   - Handle division by zero errors and provide clear feedback to the user when errors occur.
   - Ensure the program doesn't crash when invalid input is provided, guiding the user to enter valid data.

 5. Loop for Multiple Calculations
   - Allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program, providing an option to exit when desired.

6. Simple User Interface
   - Use a simple text-based interface where users can input numbers and operators.
   - Provide the user with clear instructions about how to interact with the calculator.

 7. Code Structure and Modularity
   - Organize the code into functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to enhance readability and maintainability.
